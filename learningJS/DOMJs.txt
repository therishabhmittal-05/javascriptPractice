DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
Window->document->HTML-> head and body

@to get any html code of a website it will be helpful
@document.getElementByID("_idName").innerHTML// to change what's inside this html tag with the _idName
@to target element(to manipulate or to edit) write document.(various options to get a element)
@getElementByID.className,id,tagName.....etc
@getElementByID.set and getAttribute will overwrite the attribute (its a common mistake dev does)
@ we can store this domselector result in other variable also and inner workings of it can be done using dot operator as variable is a object.
@getElementByID("_idName").innerHTML,.textContent,.innerText gives you the text content inside that id.
 diff b/w textContent and innerText is that textContent o/p all teh content whether hidden or not by innerText gives only visible content, innerHTML will give the complete html inside the id whether other tags, content etc
